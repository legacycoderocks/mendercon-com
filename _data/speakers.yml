  name: "Dan"
  surname: "Prager"
  company: "Prager's Law"
  title: "Agile Coach"
  bio: |
    An early adopter of Agile, including the technical XP practices, Dan coaches and trains people in Agile and DevOps in startups, scale-ups, and larger organisations. Dan is a passionate supporter of the Australian Agile community, and a regular speaker and participant at conferences and meet-ups.

    After completing his PhD in computational mathematical physics on the numerical evolution of a class of black holes, Dan left academia in the 1990’s to pursue a career in software development. He quickly discovered that trying to plan everything up front made very little sense, and went looking for better approaches. This led him to iterative and incremental approaches to creating software, fore-runners of Agile. Later he learned that Agile approaches generalise to all forms of knowledge work.

    Dan is married to Andi Herman. Together they created YouPatch (a web site for turning images into patchwork quilt designs), as well as two now grown-up children, and have acquired additional now grown-up kids along the way.
