question: "But, you have a standard event track as well?"
---

Yes! We sent out a feedback survey after the first MenderCon event and a lot of folks expressed that they would like to see pre-selected speakers as well at the next event. We want MenderCon to be _the_ event for menders, so we decided to add a second track that includes pre-selected speakers. If a participant doesnâ€™t want to join in on the standard track, they can head over to the unconference track and join in on an a community session.
