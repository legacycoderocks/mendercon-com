question: "What platform is being used to host the event? Why?"
---

This year we're hosting the event on the [Gather](https://gather.town) platform with main stage talks distributed using [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/).

The Gather platform allows event attendees to move around a virtual, game-like environment. It is like an old 8-bit video game that you play in your web browser. You can move your avatar around the virtual space. 

As you get closer to other avatars, you can share you'll see their video and hear their audio and they'll be able to see and hear you.

Gather has [a few useful guides]([https://support.gather.town/help/gather-basics](https://support.gather.town/hc/en-us)) to help you get started. Take a peek. Get used to the environment. Customize your avatar. Make sure your web browser and camera are set up correctly.

Our experience was that Gather helps with networking as attendees can "walk" around the space and organically strike up conversations with others.

The main stage content is visible via a live stream on YouTube, which can be watched from Gather or via our YouTube channel.
