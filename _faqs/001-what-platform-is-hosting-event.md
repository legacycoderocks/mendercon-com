question: "What platform is being used to host the event? Why?"
---

This year we're hosting the event on the [Gather](https://gather.town) platform with main stage talks distributed using [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/).

The Gather platform allows event attendees to move around a virtual, game-like environment. This is not a virtual realitiy event, to be completely clear. Gather is more like an old 8-bit video game that you play in your web browser. You can move your avatar around the virtual space, and as you get closer to other avatars, you can share you'll see their video and hear their audio and they'll be able to see and hear you.

Gather has a bunch of really useful [guides]([https://support.gather.town/help/gather-basics](https://support.gather.town/hc/en-us)) to help you get started. Take a peek. Get used to the environment. Customize your avatar. Make sure your web browser and camera are set up correctly.

Our hope is that Gather will help with networking, because attendees will be able to "walk" around the space and organically strike up conversations with the people in attendance.

The main stage content is going to be visible via a live stream on YouTube, which can be watched on the YouTube website or it can be viewed by moving your avatar in the main stage room in the Gather environment.
