question: "What do I need to prepare to pitch a session?"
---

This depends on the kind of session that you want to run. On the simplest end, you can just prepare a topic or idea
that youâ€™d like to explore. That would be perfect for a purely discussion format. On the more complicated end, you
can craft a slide deck and presentation or walk through a live coding demo. Those might work well if you plan on
doing most or all of the talking during the session. We predict that many sessions are going to mix some elements of
each of these approaches.
