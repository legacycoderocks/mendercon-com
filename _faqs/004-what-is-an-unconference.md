question: "What's the unconference track about?"
---

Simply put, an unconference is a conference that does not have a predetermined set of speakers or talks. The people who
show up to the event are the ones who decide what gets talked about.

The unconference format also creates an opportunity to elevate voices who are not normally heard from. At a traditional
conference, the list of speakers and topics is curated in some form by the organizers. This can often lead to the
conference schedule being dominated by people who are well known or people who have gotten practice speaking in the past.
While we welcome people with speaking experience and notoriety, itâ€™s important to us that we create a space to where
those who are not normally selected have a chance to speak. This is why we have a standard event track as well as an unconference track.
