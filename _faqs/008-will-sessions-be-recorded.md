question: "Will the sessions be recorded?"
---

All sessions on the main stage will be recorded, and the recorded videos will be posted to the [MenderCon YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mendercon) after we've had a chance to edit them. You can expect the videos to be available within a month or two after the event is over.

None of the open space content is recorded. From feedback we've collected in previous years, when open space sessions are being recorded, some participants feel like they can't be candid. That's fair. We want to create a space where people feel they can show up and be themselves.
