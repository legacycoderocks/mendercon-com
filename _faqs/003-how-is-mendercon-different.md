question: "What makes this different than every other virtual conference I've been to?"
---

At MenderCon, we celebrate what makes us different from other software developers. Our event is different because we celebrate fixing bugs, rejoice in testing, and get giddy about legacy code. You'll find a standard event track that has pre-selected speakers as well as an unconference track where you create the sessions. If you don't see something on the schedule that you would like to take part in, you can create the space yourself and invite others to join you during the pitch session.
