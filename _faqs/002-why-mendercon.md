question: "Why is the conference called MenderCon?"
---

The term "mender" was coined by the founders of [Corgibytes](https://corgibytes.com), M. Scott Ford and Andrea Goulet,
 after Scott saw an ad for a Maker Fest event and he thought, “Where’s the event for people who like to fix things?!” 
 That’s exactly what MenderCon will ideally be - an event for people who are passionate about mending software systems.
